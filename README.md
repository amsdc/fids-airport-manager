# fids-airport-manager
A sensible, usuable Flight Information Display System, created by frustrated frequent travellers who are fed up with AAI's ability to manage airports so efficiently. This repository contains clients to modify flight information in the displays. 

# Important
Due to the time constraints and restrictions on technical complexity of the CBSE Class 12 Computer Science project, the team was unable to build a production-ready version. The current version is only for demonstration purposes.

The original architecture was designed to be based on the Server-Client networking model, using real time communication protocols such as WebSocket. The server would be a REST API with Microservices. Redundancy and algorithmic efficiency were important design factors.

If any airport operations authority is interested in the development of the production version project, please drop a mail at amsdc.webmaster@gmail.com. Mention the Airport Name, code and expected number of displays in the mail.
